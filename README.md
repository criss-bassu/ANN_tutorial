This project is a tutorial on how to create and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python, demostrating the process step-by-step: loading and preprocessing data, and building, training, and evaluating a multi-layer neural network model.

**Features**
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Shows how to load a CSV into a DataFrame, split the data, and normalize inputs.
- Building an ANN: Shows how to create a neural network model in Keras using the Sequential API, with Dense layers and activation functions.
- Training: Compiles the model, sets the optimizer, defines the loss function, and tracks metrics.
- Validation and Evaluation: Splits data for validation, evaluates the model on data that has not been seen yet, and measures performance metrics.
- Visualization: Shows examples on how to visualize training.

**Running the Tutorial**
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open the tutorialANN.ipynb notebook (e.g. with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).
- Run the cells in order.
